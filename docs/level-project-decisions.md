# Level project decisions (2026-10-28)

- Checked `main` at `f5c63a22483feeeb29583853dab0c0911af5c09a`; the original `GAME_VERSION` is 0.17.0. New runtime release is 0.18.0. `BASE_COMMIT` in the furniture patch is `7b99da5` and remains a strict legacy baseline; new projects record the checked main HEAD. The proposal's `5d3a30e` is neither main nor the furniture baseline.
- Project `schemaVersion` is **2**. “2.1” identifies the proposal revision, not a serialized schema version. Architecture's nested `schemaVersion` remains 1. `compatibleWith` lists game versions, not Git commits.
- All distances are model units with `metricScaleVerified: false`. Minimum new passage width is 1.10 (error); corridor width below 2.0 is a warning. Existing unedited Floor 5 doors are exempt.
- Door swing is automatic in `doors.mjs`, including two leaves on wide apertures and approach-aware opening. `hinge` and `opensToward` are not required. V09 checks runtime-supported access instead.
- The existing engine renders window parapets, but Floor 5 uses special case dimensions. New levels must use `sill` for visible and physical geometry. Glass is solid before breakage; opening has no leaf or wall collision. The project must not claim free traversal through glazed or window segments.
- Canonical new ZIP paths are `project.json`, `assets/models/<sha256>.glb`, `assets/posters/<safe-id>.webp`, optional `preview/plan.png`, `preview/view3d.png`, and `AGENT_BRIEF.md`. Legacy `projekt.json` plus `models/` is accepted only as an input.
- A version 1 patch is retained verbatim under `legacyPatch` when migrated. This preserves emptyFixed, architecture, posters, treatments, dimensions, mounts and old metadata; normalization must not destroy the original.
- The public example must be synthetic. Private plan data and unverified local models are never added to a public level manifest.

Baseline: `node tools/owner-door-traversal.mjs` passed 102 directional cases; `node tools/verify-owner-runtime.mjs` passed 195 SHA-256 entries. The broad Node suite requires a local `three` resolution shim for vendored addon imports; without it six files fail at module resolution before assertions run.

## Shared building workflow (2026-10-28, baseline 47728ea)

- Both `new.html` and `new.html?mode=edit-floor5` use the same plan/3D tools. The original editor remains available for compatibility.
- `project-scene.mjs` resolves the authored scene for UI, collision handoff and FPS. Floor 5 retains source polygons, routes and a pinned baseline; source edits and removals are applied before physics is built. Default FPS without a level parameter still uses the original world path.
- Room strokes create their floor and four walls; one click places a standard door/opening or a window/glass span on an existing wall, replacing that span. No separate collision drawing is required. Furniture models are shared with the FPS preview, and collider dimensions use local width/depth, rotation and elevation exactly once.
- Floor 5 projects inherit the existing 5+5 anchors if no gameplay overrides exist. Engine validation checks the resolved scene. Original unmodified doors retain their width exemption.
- Schema remains 2; these are additive behaviors within that contract. Editor version is 3.2.0, compatible game version remains 0.18.0; the historical furniture BASE_COMMIT is unchanged.
- The export is deterministic geometry plus a derived collision map and an agent brief. It makes implementation reproducible; no promise of error-free autonomous changes replaces engine/browser verification.

Shared-wall compilation also removes every underlying solid span when a window/glass part is fitted across overlapping room walls. A real shot-clearance regression confirms that no invisible opaque wall survives behind a broken window. Capsule traversal is simulated from both sides in the isolated level world; the original 102-case Floor 5 regression remains separate.

Publication verification found a browser environment with WebGL disabled. The new studio now creates its 3D renderer lazily: plan editing and JSON/ZIP remain usable without a GPU. A real Chromium test disables WebGL contexts, builds a room with the mouse, checks the clear 3D warning, and downloads the authored JSON. FPS/3D still require WebGL 2.

## Free authoring and FPS walk view (editor 3.3.1)

- Placement warnings no longer veto inserting, dragging, rotating or exporting furniture. The source project may contain temporary collisions or furniture outside floor polygons. `validateLevel` still fails such a level, and the bot match button still requires motor approval. This changes only authoring, not physics.
- Catalogue cards use the existing audited GLB thumbnail paths. The editor's 3D preview now calls `buildProjectFurniture`, the same model builder used by custom FPS levels. The first-person walk page instantiates the real FPS `Renderer` and `createWorld` with the current browser-local project. It finds a legal standing point without requiring gameplay anchors and drives the existing `world.move` capsule and automatic door simulation. Missing objectives are off-map renderer placeholders only; saved JSON/ZIP is untouched.
- The walk page is a private design preview in the editor, with no bots, weapons or match objectives. The existing bot match remains a separate validated action. Schema remains 2 and game compatibility remains 0.18.0. Model units remain unverified real-world metres.
- Editor 3.3.1 pins the HTML entry points and changed module imports to a release query. GitHub Pages caches static assets for ten minutes; a previously opened browser could otherwise receive new HTML with the prior JavaScript and fail during startup. This is an asset-cache revision only, not a schema or game-version change.

## Moving the build view and restoring the kitchen chair (editor 3.4.0)

- Plan and 3D views have visible directional controls plus continuous WASD/arrow movement. Directions follow the screen in plan view and the camera's ground-plane orientation in 3D. Right/middle/Space dragging pans both views; dragging empty 3D space still orbits. These camera actions never mutate project geometry, autosave, or undo history.
- The orange kitchen-chair card is a studio preset that saves the existing audited `kenney:furniture-kit:chairdesk` asset ID with `chairRole: kitchen`. The public FPS and the studio share the same GLB and color builder. This adds no new binary model or schema field; the role was already supported by the furniture contract.

## Direct 3D building and ordinary orange chair (editor 3.5.0)

- The 3.4 kitchen preset used an office-chair GLB. This was the wrong shape. Editor 3.5 replaces it with a six-part procedural dining chair (seat, back, four metal legs), matching the existing authored blue chair silhouette. Studio and custom FPS call the same geometry builder. An exact-name migration upgrades only the mislabeled 3.4 preset in browser drafts and imported JSON/ZIP; intentionally chosen office chairs remain unchanged. No new binary asset or project schema version is needed.
- Both canvases call the same build operation: rectangle room/corridor, two-point wall, and paint-over-wall doors/windows/glass/openings. 3D rays choose the visible wall surface for attachment and the ground plane for rectangles; tagged geometry makes architecture, furniture and gameplay markers selectable. A transparent 3D footprint previews placement. Escape cancels an unfinished action and switches to selection; Delete/Backspace removes the selected item through the existing undoable removal path. Alt+left drag orbits in 3D while build tools are active; right/middle/Space drag pans. The authoring preview is cut away for visibility; the first-person walk remains the exact FPS renderer and collision engine.
- Schema remains 2; compatible game version remains 0.18.0. Entry modules and the changed shared imports have a 3.5 cache revision so reopening a previously cached GitHub Pages tab loads the new procedural chair contract consistently.
